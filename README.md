# MTGA Overlay MVP

A lightweight, open-source desktop overlay for Magic: The Gathering Arena.

## Features (MVP)
- **Log Watcher**: Automatically detects and reads MTGA logs to track game state.
- **Card Resolver**: Maps MTGA card IDs to Scryfall data.
- **Art Swap**: View alternate art for cards in your hand/battlefield.
- **Overlay**: Transparent, click-through overlay that sits on top of the game.

## Tech Stack
- **Electron**: Desktop application framework.
- **React + Vite**: UI rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the monorepo.
- **pnpm**: Fast, disk-efficient package manager.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, pnpm.
2. **Install**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Run Dev**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This will start the Electron app and the Vite dev server.

## Usage
- **Ctrl+Shift+O**: Toggle Overlay visibility.
- **Ctrl+Shift+C**: Toggle Overlay click-through mode (interactive vs passive).

## Troubleshooting
- **Logs not found**: The app looks for logs in `%AppData%/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`. If your logs are elsewhere, you may need to adjust the code (MVP limitation).
- **Overlay broken**: Ensure you are running in "Windowed" or "Borderline Windowed" mode in MTGA for best results, though it should work in Fullscreen on some systems.

## Compliance & Safety
- This tool **only** reads the local log file generated by the game.
- It does **not** inject code, read memory, or inspect network traffic.
- It does **not** automate gameplay.
- It is designed to be compliant with WotC's Fan Content Policy and safe for use (though standard "use at your own risk" applies).

## Roadmap
See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for future plans.
